# Convex_Hull
Convex-Hull algorithm visualizer
A simple visualization I made to showcase different convex hull algorithms such as graham scan, quick hull and divide & conquer.

Usage
Just to make sure the controls is as simple as possible, all you as the user needs to do is click on the algorithm from the list at the top and let the javascript do the rest of the work. Once clicked the algorithm will begin executing. And only once the current execution is finished you the user will be allowed to choosen a different algorithm.

Please note that the time it takes for the visualization is in no way representative of the speed of the alogrithm as this has been slowed down to create a more appealing affect.
